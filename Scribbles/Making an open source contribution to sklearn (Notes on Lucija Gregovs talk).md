# Making an open source contribution to sklearn (Notes on Lucija Gregovs talk)

Following my scribblings of Lucija Gregovs Talk on how to contribute to scikit-learn [on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZMnkM2OqaQ) 

Tips:

* Lerne Contributors kennen und Frage nach Hilfe
* Gute Gelegenheiten sind __hackathons__, meetups oder “ping them for a coffee on twitter”

1. Fork the repo into your account
2. Start exploring issues with tags __good first__, __help wanted__, __documentation__
   1. If not sure if been taken. Look in comment section
   2. If you start working on it, say so in the comments
   3. Still not sure -> Go to [gitter](https://gitter.im/scikit-learn/dev) and ask questions !
   4. If you are shy -> ping someone privately
   5. 
3. Address problems in github comment section.
4. Tag someone to review your contrib
5. If you coded; write tests ! If you want to push to master all your tests must pass
