# Elements of Statistical Learning: Solutions to exercises

## Chapter 2 (Overview of Supervised Learning)

### Ex. 2.1. 

Problem:

Suppose each of K-classes has an associated target $t_k$, which is a vector of all zeros, except a one in the $k$-th position. Show that classifying to the largest element of $\hat{y}$ amounts to choosing the closest target, $min_k ||t_k - \hat{y}||$, if the elements of $\hat{y}$ sum to one.



### Ex. 2.2.

Problem:

Show how to compute the Bayes decisions boundary for the simulation example in Figure 2.5.



### Ex. 2.3.

Problem:

Derive equation (2.24):
$$
d(p,N)= (1 - \frac{1}{2}^{1/N})^{1/p} 
$$
